            <h3>Project Delivery</h3>
            <p>
                An initial payment is required to start work on your project. After the first initial invoice is paid, we will go full speed on your project and have things delivered quickly. Here is how the system works:
            <ul>
                <li>1. Sitelyft Studios will invoice you the initial estimate w/ tax</li>
                <li>2. For work to start, you will need to pay 3/4 of the initial invoice</li>
                <li>3. After work is completed and you're satisfied, you will need to pay the last 1/4 of the invoice</li>
                <li>4. Lastly we will hand over full ownership over the project after the last bit of the invoice is paid</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
